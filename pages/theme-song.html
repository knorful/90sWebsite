                    Now, this is a story all about how
                    My life got flipped-turned upside down
                    And I'd like to take a minute
                    Just sit right there
                    I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
                </p>
                <p>
                    In West Philadelphia born and raised
                    On the playground was where I spent most of my days
                    Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
                    And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
                    When a couple of guys who were up to no good
                    Started making trouble in my neighborhood
                    I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
                    She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
                </p>
                <p>
                    I whistled for a cab and when it came near
                    The license plate said, "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror
                    If anything I could say that this cab was rare
                    But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air"
                </p>
                <p>
                    I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
                    And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes, smell ya later"
                    I looked at my kingdom
                    I was finally there
                    To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air
